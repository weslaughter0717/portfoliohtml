      <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
      <p>I am originally from Charleston, SC. I truely love my hometown. The beach, the people, and the food for sure.
      My mother and grandfather still live there, and while I love Charleston, I am not opposed to living elsewhere.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I currently am obsessed with coding and getting better everyday. I am working on a project for a small engineering team in Charlotte, NC.
      The project is a bluetooth location device for dental companies. I also love playing music... i have played guitar for years and a good jam session is always in the cards.
      Also working through a new Javascript book I purchased. Then lets just include all water sports, except for maybe "Marco Polo"</p>

      <h2>Mathematics</h2>
      <p>I have a true passion for mathematics and can't wait to include my existing knowledge into my coding. I recently wrote a distance calculator for 
      a project called Jam-Clash. The formula accounts for the rads of the earth and is actually called the Haversine Formula. In addition to this little tid bit,
      I have a long list of antiquity problems that keep your math skills in check.</p>

  <h3>1. Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming</h3>
  <p>If you’re curious about life as a programmer than Coders at Work is the book for you. It’s packed with interesting interviews from 15 accomplished programmers and computer scientists including Joshua Bloch, Peter Norvig, Donald Knuth, Ken Thomson, and Jamie Zawinski. The author, Peter Seibel (a programmer turned writer), got interviewees to open up about the famous projects that they worked on and the inspiring stories behind them. 
  Coders at Work gives a peek into what makes some of the greatest programmers tick and how they think. Definitely a must read!</p>

  <h3>2. 2666</h3>
  <p>Completed in 2003 shortly before his death, 2666 is not only Roberto Bolaño's masterpiece but also one of the finest and most important novels of the 21st century. It's an entire world unto itself, one — not unlike our own — filled with horror, neglect, depravity, brilliance, and beauty. Epic in scope and epitomizing the "total novel," 2666 fuses many different genres and styles to create a singular and unforgettable work of contemporary fiction. While Bolaño's swan song marked the pinnacle of a sadly truncated literary career, his immense talent, creativity, and vision endure.</p>

  <h3>3. Desert Solitaire</h3>
  <p>No author encapsulated and celebrated the American Southwest more engagingly than iconoclast and raconteur Edward Abbey. Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness — now nearly a half-century old — is a classic of environmental writing. In this autobiographical work, Abbey chronicles his time as a park ranger and reflects on landscape, culture, politics, tourism, environmental disregard, and degradation — doing so with a unique blend of ornery charm and breathtaking description. Though set in his beloved Southwest, Desert Solitaire beautifully and brashly captures the essence of the American outdoors, replete with disdain for those who'd seek to spoil its natural wonder. </p>

  <h3>4. Geek Love</h3>
  <p>This is the book I recommend more than any other — I can barely hold onto a copy of it because I am always giving it away to anyone who I think needs something that will blow the top of their skull off. On one level, it is the engaging, creepy, and extraordinary story of a family of purposely designed circus freaks, as told by the hunchback albino dwarf sister. On another level, it is a story about identity and belonging: How do you define yourself in terms of your family? Your culture? Your body? Your religion? How do you know what or who you really are?</p>

  <h3>Squaring The Circle</h3>
  <p>Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. ... The expression "squaring the circle" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.</p>

    <h3>Doubling the Cube</h3>
    <p>3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-gons (i.e., regular triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons) are all and easily constructible. Octagons are constructible on the heels of squares with a single angle bisection. All polygons obtained from the above four by doubling the number of sides are also constructible. Not so a heptagon, a 7-sided polygon.</p>

      <div>
    <h3>Constructing a regular heptagon</h3>
    <p>the most famous of the collection, is often referred to as the Delian problem due to a legend that the Delians had consulted Plato on the subject. In another form, the story asserts that the Athenians in 430 B.C. consulted the oracle at Delos in the hope to stop the plague ravaging their country. They were advised by Apollo to double his altar that had the form of a cube. As a result of several failed attempts to satisfy the god, the pestilence only worsened and at the end they turned to Plato for advice. (According to Rouse Ball and Coxeter, p 340, an Arab variant insists that the plague had broken between the children of Israel but the name of Apollo had been tactfully omitted.) According to a letter from the mathematician Eratosthenes to King Ptolemy of Egypt, Euripides mentioned the Delian problem in one of his (now lost) tragedies.</p>

    <h3>Angle trisection</h3>
    <p>The problem of trisecting a line segment is no more difficult than finding its n-th part for an arbitrary n. However, the general problem of trisecting and angle (i.e., trisecting an arbitrary angle) is not solvable in a finite number of steps. Two points must be made.</p>

  <h3>Literally Stuff I Didn't Know</h3>
  
  <ol>
<li> Pineapples are a symbol of hospitality in Charleston. Back in the day, 
          sea captains would announce their arrival and invite people to hear their stories by sticking a pineapple prominently 
          outside their homes.</li> 
<li> If the fire department comes around in Charleston saying they need to blow up your house—guess 
  what? They totally can.</li> 
<li>. That policy is pretty ironic, considering the motto of the city is “Aedes mores juraque curat” 
  which is Fancy for “She guards her buildings, customs and laws.”</li>  
<li>  All of American theatre history began in Charleston at 
  the Dock Street Theatre, the very first one built in the country.</li> 
<li>  The indomitable Stephen Colbert lived on James Island 
  as a boy. Does that make his first friends the original members of the Colbert Nation?</li>  
<li>  In a city of firsts, one that most
  people remember is Noah and Allie’s first date to the movies was filmed at the American Theatre.</li>  
<li>  Everyone’s favorite corrupt 
  politician from “House of Cards,” Frank Underwood, attended a fictionalized version of the Citadel, a renowned military college.</li>  
<li>  Local minor league team the Sea of Dogs have a Director of Fun. And their Director of Fun is Bill Murray. This guy is everywhere.</li>  
<li>  The modern Othello adaptation, “O,” was filmed entirely in Charleston. </li> 
<li> George Gershwin’s celebrated folk opera, “Porgy and 
  Bess,” is set in Catfish Row (modeled after Cabbage Row) right in Charleston.</li>  
<li>  Gershwin himself wrote the opera while staying on Folly’s Island.</li>  
<li>  The very man who inspired the character of Porgy, a goat-holding vegetable merchant by the name of Samuel Smalls, 
  is buried in the graveyard next to James Island Presbyterian.</li> 
<li>  Arguably the oldest Youtube sensation, Angry Grandpa gets up to his hijinx at his home in Charleston.</li>
